# Intro Sessions
Before the HTML/CSS curriculum begins, there will be some introductory sessions.

#### Videos
Some of these sessions can include interesting videos about computer science, careers, applications, and more.

## Session 1: Intro to Hyland
This session will introduce the students to Hyland and this partnership program. More information [here](SessionOne.md).

## Session 2: Retro Games
Follow the lesson plan for the [Retro Games](https://github.com/hytechcamps/retro-games) Hy-Tech Camp. There is no need to complete the icebreaker - simply present the PowerPoint, Kahoot quiz, and Code-Along. If the timing is tight, the most essential part of the session is the code-along.

## Session 3: Machine Learning
Follow the lesson plan for the [Machine Learning](https://github.com/hytechcamps/machine-learning) Hy-Tech Camp. There is no need to complete the icebreaker - simply present the PowerPoint, Kahoot quiz, and Follow-Along. If the timing is tight, the most essential part of the session is the follow-along.

## Session 4: Hyland Tour and Guest Speakers
This session will take place at Hyland HQ! Students should have a chance to see Hyland's campus, and hear from some Hyland employees about their careers.

## Sessions 5-8: CS Fundamentals Express
Have students work through [Code.org's CS Fundamentals Express Curriculum](https://studio.code.org/s/express-2021). This will be largely self-paced. Supplement these sessions with videos, games, and other activities that will be engaging for the students.
