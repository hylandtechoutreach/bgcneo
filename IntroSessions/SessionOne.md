# Session 1 - Intro to Hyland (6/28)
This session will introduce the students to Hyland. It should help motivate them to want to learn more. This session will also provide an opportunity to troubleshoot technical difficulties.

This session can move at a relatively slow pace - there are not too many important things to get through.

## Intro to Hyland PowerPoint
>TODO: Update this
Present the Hyland Intro PowerPoint so the students learn a bit about what Hyland is all about.

## Icebreakers
Have students introduce themselves through an icebreaker activity. Have each student post their answer to some icebreaker questions in the chat - this will help them practice using the chat.

Some possible questions:

- Favorite Movie
- Favorite Musical Artist
- Favorite School Subject
- Favorite Vacation Destination
- Favorite TV Show

## Intake Questionnaire
After the icebreakers, have the students complete the [intake questionnaire](https://forms.gle/Q3mytWNRKGUkeX8U6). This will help us get to know each of them a little better. Responses can be checked [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fUBJxTOeAclXJgtoPCcqP6OctHSEXX8rzb7iI8lcjqw/edit#responses).

## Remaining Time - Fun & Games
Use any remaining time to play some fun games. Students can vote on what they would like to do.

### Sporcle Quizzes
Sporcle allows the whole group to work as a team to try to answer trivia questions. Project the quiz, and students can answer out loud (they do not need to join from their computers). Some of the questions may be somewhat relevant to the curriculum, but the main focus is to have fun.

### Online Pictionary
Use [Drawasaurus](https://www.drawasaurus.org/) to play online pictionary. Create a private room with a password, and share the link with the students. There is also an option to add custom words - to make this a little more relevant, some computer science and/or web development words can be added.

### Telephone with Pictures
Use [Drawphone](https://drawphone.tannerkrewson.com/) to play an online game of telephone with pictures (like Telestrations). Start a party, create the game, and share the link with the students. It may be a good idea to set the drawing time limit and the number of turns to manage the time. Students will draw something based on a prompt. Then, they will have to come up with a prompt based on a drawing someone else drew. This process continues for however many rounds - the fun part is at the end, when all of the drawings are revealed.
