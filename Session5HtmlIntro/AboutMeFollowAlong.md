# About Me: Follow-Along
With this exercise, you will create a webpage that shows some information about yourself. Start from [this empty Repl](https://repl.it/@JosephMaxwell/EmptyWeb#index.html), and then follow the instructions below.

## Setup
1. In the **index.html** file, add the `<html></html>` opening and closing tag
1. Inside of the `<html>` and `</html>`, add the `<body></body>` opening and closing tag
1. Inside of the `<body>` and `</body>`, add a `<h1></h1>` header tag that says "About Me"
1. Click the **Run** button to make sure your page is working!

At the end of the **Setup**, your code should look like this (try to match the spacing):
```html
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>About Me</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Greeting and Basic Information
1. Under the `h1` header tag, add in a `<p></p>` paragraph tag welcoming the user to your page
1. Add another paragraph containing your name
1. Add another paragraph containing your grade level
1. Add another paragraph containing your favorite thing to do

At the end of this section, your code should look something like this:
```html
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Welcome to my page!</p>
        <p>My name is Arthur Read</p>
        <p>I am in 3rd grade</p>
        <p>I am from Elwood City</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Favorite Animal
1. Under the last `p` paragraph tag, add a smaller `h3` header that says "Favorite Animal"
1. Add an image of your favorite animal
    1. Find an image somewhere online, and copy the **image URL**
    1. Add an `<img>` image tag under the `h3` header
    1. Set the `src` of the image to the URL, in quotes

## Final HTML
```html
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Welcome to my page!</p>
        <p>My name is Arthur Read</p>
        <p>I am in 3rd grade</p>
        <p>I am from Elwood City</p>

        <h3>Favorite Animal</h3>
