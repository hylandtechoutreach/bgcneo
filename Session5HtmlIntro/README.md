Start with a fun warm-up. Then a lecture followed by a kahoot. Start the coding by making sure each student has a Repl account. Have each of them share a Multiplayer link to their project. Students then build basic websites about themselves. They learn about the `html`, `body`, `h1`, `p`, and `img` elements. They should have an opportunity to share their work.

## Overview: Basic HTML Tags
For the first content lesson of the class, go over HTML tags. The purpose of this lesson is to show the students what they can create with some basic tags. Overall, this first lesson should be pretty straightforward. Introduce HTML, show the students some examples and have them get some hands-on experience writing HTML.

## Warm Up
It may be helpful to begin this session with an Icebreaker. After that, the instructor can pose a question to the students and let them write down their answers. The question could be something like "What do you think HTML does?", "How do you think websites work?", etc. Students can volunteer answers after 5 minutes or so.

## Lecture
For this lecture, focus mostly on how the tags are used to accomplish the goals of the webpage.

## Group Activities
### Name That Tag
For each Tag, instructors can ask multiple questions, and call on students randomly.

### Follow-Along Activity: About Me Website
Start building an "About Me" website: [AboutMeFollowAlong](AboutMeFollowAlong.md)

## Individual Exercise: About Me Website Updates
Students should continue building their "About Me" website: [AboutMeIndividual](AboutMeIndividual.md)

## Challenge: Multiple HTML files
The students will be challenged to create multiple HTML files and link between them: [MultipleHtmlFilesChallenge](MultipleHtmlFilesChallenge.md)

There is also a challenge for the students to build a "Choose Your Own Adventure" game: [ChooseYourOwnAdventureChallenge](ChooseYourOwnAdventureChallenge.md)
