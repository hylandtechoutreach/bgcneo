# More CSS
In this session, introduce more CSS selectors that unlock more of the power of CSS. Also, introduce a couple new properties students can use to make their websites even better.

## Warm up: Online Pictionary
Play a game of [Skribblio](https://skribbl.io) (online pictionary) with some HTML/CSS words built in. The purpose of the warm-up is mainly for the students to have fun.

In the event that Skribblio does not work, try using [Drawsaurus](https://www.drawasaurus.org/).

## Lecture: More Selectors
Present the [More Selectors PowerPoint Presentation](MoreSelectors.pptx).

## Kahoot
Play through the [Kahoot Quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/share/css-selectors/5d1e3b60-1a41-4ab6-98f6-9926adba496e) to review the material from the lecture.

## Code-Along
Walk through the [Rainbow Code-Along](RainbowCodeAlong.md) activity with the students. There is some existing HTML, and the idea is to update it with CSS styles. It will be required to update the HTML to add `class` and `id` attributes, and update the CSS to select elements based on them.

### Multiplayer Repls
Before jumping into the activity, make sure each student has a Repl account and has properly forked the starter Repl projects. Students should all send along their Multiplayer Repl Links.

## Individual Work
Have students work on the [Rainbow Individual](RainbowIndividual.md) exercises. They will have an opportunity to update the website with some new HTML and CSS.
