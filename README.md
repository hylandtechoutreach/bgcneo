# Hyland + Boys & Girls Club
This repository contains material for Hyland's Partnership with Boys & Girls Club of Northeast Ohio.

## Basic Info
Students will meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10:30am-12:30pm ET at The King Kennedy Club. Students should arrive at 10am ET and will use the 10-10:30 for icebreakers and a "temperature check." The program will run from June 21st through July 28th. The first four weeks will be introductory sessions and one-off activities. The following two weeks will cover HTML & CSS, culminating in a final capstone project. Student-facing content is surfaced through [this Gitbook](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/bgcneo). Students will use a variety of technologies throughout the different activities, but will ultimately use [Replit](https://replit.com) to host their websites.
