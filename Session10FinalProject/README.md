# Final Project - Capstone
The students should have about two sessions to work on their final projects. For the final session, they should present their final projects. These projects should reflect all they have learned throughout the program.

## Before the Project
Spend a little time reviewing the material before the project. There is a comprehensive [Baamboozle quiz](https://www.baamboozle.com/game/518844) that covers everything from the program.

## Multiplayer Repls
Before jumping into the project work, make sure each student has a Repl account and has properly forked the starter Repl projects. Students should all send along their Multiplayer Repl Links.

## Description
Students can view the [description](StudentDesc.md) for the project for guidance.

## Example
A mock project that meets the technical requirements is available [here](https://bgcneocapstoneexample.josephmaxwell.repl.co/). Students could create something similar.

## Focus
The students can spend a good amount of time focusing on the content of their website rather than the actual HTML/CSS code. They should put time into writing about themselves, finding images, and things like that. It is important for them to feel like they are creating something that will be beneficial to them.
