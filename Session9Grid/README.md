# Grid
In this session, introduce HTML `<div>` elements and the CSS grid system. This is a little advanced, but hopefully students will be able to follow along.

This session does not have as much fun stuff up front - but if students work hard and get through the material, they will be rewarded with a chance to create pixel art in Piskel.

## Lecture
Start by presenting the [CSS Grid PowerPoint Presentation](CssGrid.pptx). This introduces HTML `div` elements, and walks through some of the CSS properties necessary to make a grid.

## Code-Along
Walk through the [Pixels Code-Along](PixelsCodeAlong.md) activity. It uses `div`s and a grid to make a small pixel art PAC-MAN. There will end up being quite a lot of HTML code, but most of it is fairly repetitive.

### Multiplayer Repls
Before jumping into the activity, make sure each student has a Repl account and has properly forked the starter Repl projects. Students should all send along their Multiplayer Repl Links.

## Individual Work
Have students work on the [Pixels Individual](PixelsIndividual.md) exercises. These will give them a chance to update their existing code on their own.

## Piskel
Hopefully there will be some time at the end to introduce Piskel. [Piskel](https://piskelapp.com) is a website for creating pixel art. It is much easier to use than a bunch of HTML `div` elements, so students may have fun with it. There is a quick demo guide [here](https://hylandtechoutreach.github.io/ucs/Session4Animation/PiskelDemo.html).

## Sharing Work
During the last 5-10 minutes of the session, allow students to share their work. This could be either their websites, or anything they have created in Piskel.
